# Astro Blog
The fastest way to get a blog started in Astro ðŸš€

`astro-blog` automatically adds several routes, and provides several schemas to get your blog up and running in minutes, not hours.

With built-in pagination, specifying author profiles, creating tags for your articles, and also support for draft articles. `astro-blog` should cover everything you need to get creating content for your website.

## Installation

### Astro Add

`astro-blog` supports installing via the `astro add` command for super easy install:

```bash
## Astro
astro add astro-blog
```

### Manual Install
Or if you'd prefer to instal manually

```bash
## npm
npm install astro-blog

## pnpm
pnpm install astro-blog
```

Then add the integration to your `astro.config.mjs`

```diff
+ import AstroBlog from 'astro-blog'

export default defineConfig{
    integrations: [
        ...,
+       AstroBlog({
+           site: 'https://www.mysite.com',
+       })
    ]
}
```

### Set up schemas

Just one last step before you can start adding content is to set up your content collection schemas.

`astro-blog` provides schemas for Articles, Authors and Tags. So we can easily add definitions in the `src/content/config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'
import { ArticleSchema, AuthorSchema, TagSchema } from 'astro-blog/schema'

export const collections = {
    blog: defineCollection({
        type: 'content',
        schema: ArticleSchema,
    }),


    author: defineCollection({
        type: 'content',
        schema: AuthorSchema,
    }),

    tag: defineCollection({
        type: 'content',
        schema: TagSchema,
    }),
}
```

Now you're all set up to start adding content! ðŸ”¥ðŸ™Œ

### Creating content

Now you can create authors in your `content/author` folder, tags in your `content/tag` folder, and finally articles in your `content/blog` folder.

```md
# content/author/jacob.md
---
name: Jacob Jenkins
description: Just some dude, doin some stuff

imageAlt: 'One hell of a guy'

```

```md
